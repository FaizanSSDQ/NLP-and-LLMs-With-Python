# NLP-Based Text Generation Using N-Gram Models

## Overview

This project explores the fundamentals of Natural Language Processing (NLP) by building a text generator using N-Gram models. Starting with word frequency distributions, the project progresses to unigram, bigram, and trigram models to generate coherent text based on learned patterns.

## Project Structure

* **Data Preprocessing:** Tokenization, text cleaning, and preparation for modeling.
* **Frequency Distribution:** Analyzing word occurrences to determine probabilities.
* **N-Gram Models:** Implementing unigram, bigram, and trigram models for text generation.
* **Evaluation & Insights:** Observing model behavior and discussing limitations.

## Installation & Setup

To run this project, install the required dependencies as guided in the Notebook. You can use simple Anaconda framework and don't need any additional GPUs.

Modify the input text and model parameters to generate different results.

## Results & Insights
**Unigram Model:** Generates text based on single-word probabilities, often lacking coherence.
**Bigram Model:** Improves fluency by considering previous words.
**Trigram Model:** Generates more contextually relevant text by incorporating two previous words.
While these statistical models capture local patterns, they lack deep contextual understanding.

## What‚Äôs Next? üöÄ
The next step toward more intelligent text generation is transitioning to Deep Learning models, such as:

Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNN)
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) & LSTMs
Transformer-based architectures (GPT, BERT, etc.)
