## Project Description

This project walks you through the evolution of text generation, from traditional N-gram models to the powerful Transformer architecture. You'll gain a solid understanding of how NLP libraries in Python facilitate tasks like:

* Understanding the basics of Generative AI.
* Exploring the historical context of text generation.
* Learning about RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs.
* Understanding the revolutionary Transformer model.
* Implementing a basic chatbot using the transformer library.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd [project directory]
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries:**

    It is recommended to use a virtual environment. You can create one using venv:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Linux/macOS
    venv\Scripts\activate # On Windows
    ```

    Then install the required libraries, for example using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install notebook transformers torch #add other required libraries.
    ```

4.  **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook NLP_Libraries_Guide.ipynb
    ```

    (Replace `NLP_Libraries_Guide.ipynb` with the actual name of your notebook file.)

5.  **Follow the instructions within the notebook.**
