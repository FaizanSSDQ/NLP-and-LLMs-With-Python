# Word Embeddings with Skip-gram, CBOW, and GloVe in PyTorch

This project explores the implementation and application of word embeddings using Skip-gram and CBOW models in PyTorch. It also demonstrates how to leverage pretrained GloVe embeddings for improved performance.

## Overview

This repository provides code and resources for learning about word embeddings and their application to text classification. Key components include:

* **Skip-gram Model:** Implementation of the Skip-gram model for learning word embeddings.
* **CBOW Model:** Implementation of the Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) model for learning word embeddings.
* **GloVe Embeddings:** Integration of pretrained GloVe embeddings to enhance model performance.
* **Text Classification:** Application of learned and pretrained embeddings for text classification tasks.
* **Optional Advanced Applications:** An optional section for exploring advanced applications of word embeddings.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.x
* PyTorch
* NumPy
* NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
* Other common Python libraries (e.g., `sklearn`)

You can install the required packages using pip:
