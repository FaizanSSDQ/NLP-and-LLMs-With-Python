    "\n",
    "This project serves as an introduction to the field of language modeling, focusing on creating a text generator tailored for composing 90s rap songs. I have utilized histogram N-gram models, implemented through the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). This approach allows me to construct revealing histograms, shedding light on nuanced cadences of word frequencies and distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These initial steps lay the foundation for understanding the intricacies of linguistic patterns.  will first try to generate or predict a word based on simple probability distribution. After analyzing the challenges we would face, we will move to improved solution, that is N-Grams model. Progressing forward, I have implmented bigram and trigram models as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this journey, we are going to explore various training strategies and embrace fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including tokenization and sequence analysis. As you traverse this enriching path, you will gain profound insights into the art of generating text, culminating in the ability to craft 90s rap lyrics that resonate with the era's unique style and rhythm.\n",

    "This project implemented a **statistical approach** to language modeling using **N-Grams**, demonstrating how word sequences can be used to predict and generate text. While effective, this method **lacks deep contextual understanding** and does not generalize well beyond the given dataset.  \n",

    "To achieve more **intelligent, dynamic, and human-like text generation**, the next step is to transition to **Deep Learning-based models**, such as **Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformer-based architectures** like GPT. These models can learn **semantic relationships** and generate more coherent and meaningful text.  \n",
